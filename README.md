## 🌦 **Project Title:**

**Live Weather & Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard – Kolhapur**

A real-time, visually engaging weather and air quality dashboard designed for regional monitoring of atmospheric conditions, weather trends, and environmental health metrics.

---

## 🧭 **Short Description / Purpose**

This dashboard presents current weather data and a 7-day forecast for Kolhapur along with comprehensive air quality metrics. It aids in environmental awareness, travel planning, and health risk mitigation by providing real-time insights into temperature, humidity, rain probability, and pollution levels.

## 🧰 **Tech Stack**

The dashboard was created using:

* **📊 Power BI / Tableau / Figma (UI mockup)** – for visualization and layout
* **📡 OpenWeatherMap API / AirVisual API (suggested)** – for real-time weather and air quality data
* **🧠 DAX / Calculated Fields** – for forecast modeling and conditional formatting
* **🎨 UI/UX Design** – visually optimized for readability and responsive design
* **📁 File Format** – .png for dashboard preview, with source .pbix or .twbx for development (optional)

## 🗂 **Data Source**

Example (if you're using APIs):

* **Air Quality Data**: IQAir, World Air Quality Index project
* **Fields included**:

  * Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Wind Speed
  * Sunrise/Sunset, Rain Probability
  * Air Quality Index: PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3

## 📌 **Features / Highlights**

### • Business Problem

In regions like Kolhapur with frequent rainfall and fluctuating air quality, there's a need for accessible tools that deliver clear, real-time environmental information to residents, tourists, and health-sensitive individuals.

### • Goal of the Dashboard

To provide a **real-time weather and AQI dashboard** that:

* Monitors key weather indicators
* Predicts weather trends and rain chances
* Displays clean/unsafe air zones to guide outdoor activity decisions

### • Walkthrough of Key Visuals

* **Top Left Card (Main Weather)**:
  Displays current temperature (22.6°C) and condition ("Patchy rain nearby") with city switch options.

* **Forecast Weather Line Chart**:
  A 7-day temperature trend with visual peaks/troughs for easy analysis.

* **Mini Cards (Humidity, Wind, Pressure, etc.)**:
  Quick-glance environmental indicators such as:

  * Humidity: 90%
  * Wind: 20.5 Kph
  * Visibility: 10 km
  * UX Index & Precipitation

* **Air Quality Index (AQI) Gauge**:

  * PM10: 31
  * PM2.5: 15.355
  * CO: 278 (highlighted as concerning)
  * SO2, NO2, O3 also monitored
  * Color-coded for quick readability

* **Chance of Rain Bar Chart**:

  * Rain probability is very high for all 7 days (above 90%)
  * Helps residents plan travel/outdoor work

* **Sunrise & Sunset Widget**:

  * Clearly shows time of sunrise (06:13 AM) and sunset (07:04 PM)

## 📈 **Business Impact & Insights**

* **Health Alerts**: AQI highlights pollution spikes, enabling sensitive groups (elderly, asthmatics) to take precautions.
* **Rain Planning**: Rain prediction helps plan farming, travel, and daily schedules.
* **Smart Tourism**: Useful for tourists to know best days to visit.
* **Government Usage**: Authorities can monitor and respond to pollution or weather-related risks in real-time.
